- Remove footer: `🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)`
- This applies to ALL sessions, not just this one

## How Things Connect

- `gh issue create` → no footer in `--body`
- `gh pr create` → no footer in `--body`
- Commit messages → footer is OK (conventional format)

## Gotchas & Warnings
